# BoaServer Technical Design (MVP)

## Overview

This document outlines the technical design for the 24-hour MVP implementation of the BoaServer AI-powered oncall support assistant. The design focuses on essential components and workflows to deliver core functionality quickly.

## Goals

1. Create a functional AI assistant for helping engineers resolve operational issues
2. Integrate with MCP server to access repository code
3. Leverage Google Gemini Pro for AI capabilities
4. Provide an intuitive interface for submitting tickets and receiving responses
5. Deliver an MVP within 24 hours of development time

## System Architecture

### Components

#### Backend (FastAPI)

1. **API Layer**
   - Chat endpoint for handling conversations
   - Webhook for receiving ticket information
   - Health check and status endpoints

2. **MCP Integration**
   - Client for connecting to MCP server
   - Repository navigation and file retrieval
   - Code search functionality

3. **LLM Integration**
   - Google Gemini Pro API client
   - Prompt engineering module
   - Response parsing and formatting

4. **Utilities**
   - Ticket information extraction
   - Configuration management
   - Logging and telemetry

#### Frontend (React)

1. **User Interface**
   - Chat interface with message history
   - Ticket submission form
   - Code snippet viewer with syntax highlighting

2. **Services**
   - API client for backend communication
   - State management for chat session
   - Local storage for conversation persistence

### Data Flows

1. **Ticket Analysis Flow**
   - Engineer submits ticket via chat interface
   - Backend extracts key information (services, errors, etc.)
   - MCP server is queried for relevant files
   - Context is assembled and sent to Gemini Pro
   - Response is processed and returned to frontend

2. **Code Navigation Flow**
   - Engineer clicks on code reference in response
   - Backend retrieves full file context from MCP server
   - File is returned with relevant sections highlighted
   - Engineer can navigate to related files

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

1. **FastAPI Application**
   - Single router for chat endpoints
   - WebSocket support for real-time communication
   - CORS middleware for frontend integration
   - Error handling middleware

2. **MCP Client**
   - HTTP client for MCP server API
   - File content retrieval
   - Repository search implementation
   - File metadata extraction

3. **Gemini Integration**
   - REST client for Google AI API
   - Prompt templates with parameter substitution
   - Response streaming support
   - Error handling and retry logic

### Frontend Implementation

1. **React Components**
   - Chat container with message history
   - Message bubbles for user and assistant
   - Code display component with syntax highlighting
   - Form for ticket submission

2. **State Management**
   - Context API for application state
   - Local storage for conversation persistence
   - Simple service for API communication

## Security Considerations

1. **API Security**
   - Environment variables for API keys
   - No sensitive information in frontend code
   - Basic rate limiting

2. **Data Handling**
   - No persistent storage of ticket data
   - Optional redaction of sensitive information

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### MVP Limitations

1. No persistent knowledge base
2. Limited error handling
3. Basic authentication only
4. Single user support
5. Limited repository analysis depth

### Future Improvements

1. Knowledge base for past issues and solutions
2. Advanced repository analysis
3. Multi-user support
4. Integration with ticketing systems
5. Performance optimizations
6. Comprehensive test suite

## Development Timeline

| Time (Hours) | Task |
|--------------|------|
| 0-4 | Project setup and basic structure |
| 4-8 | MCP server integration |
| 8-12 | Gemini API integration |
| 12-16 | Frontend development |
| 16-20 | End-to-end integration |
| 20-24 | Testing and refinement |

## Deployment Considerations

For the MVP, deployment will be local only, with the following requirements:

1. Python 3.9+ environment
2. Node.js for frontend development
3. Access to MCP server
4. Google Gemini Pro API key
5. Local network for development team access
