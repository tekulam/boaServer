Building Oncall AI

## Prompt for Design diagram
create high level system diagram for the followiing:
Requirements for AI-Powered Oncall Support Assistant I'm looking to develop a comprehensive oncall support assistant that helps engineers effectively resolve operational tickets. It can be easily integrated salesforce, jira, freshdesk like platforms. Please help me create a detailed set of functional and non-functional requirements for this system. The tool should act as an intelligent assistant that connects to our code repositories, documentation, previous tickets, and team communication channels to provide context-aware support for engineers during oncall situations. Key objectives:
1. Assist with troubleshooting and root cause analysis of operational issues
2. Suggest code refactoring opportunities to prevent similar issues
3. Leverage AI capabilities to enhance support quality
4. Future-proof our incident response processes
 Core use case: When an engineer receives an operational ticket, they should be able to engage with this tool to get intelligent assistance throughout the resolution process. Please include requirements for:
* User interaction model (chatbot/CLI/web interface)
* Required integrations (code repositories, documentation systems, ticketing systems, chat platforms)
* AI capabilities (NLP, code analysis, pattern recognition, recommendation systems)
* Knowledge management (how to build and maintain the knowledge base)
* Security and access control considerations
* Performance expectations and scalability requirements
* Metrics and success criteria for the tool
* Future-proofing strategies
 Additionally, consider:
* How the tool should handle different types of incidents
* What a typical conversation flow would look like
* How the system should learn from past incidents
* Privacy and compliance requirements
* Implementation phases and prioritization
 Feel free to ask clarifying questions to help refine these requirements.
1. via mcp servers, it will be connected to the repositories
2. we can have file-system managers to access design documents and code locally
